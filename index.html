      <h2>About Callie</h2>
      <p>
        Callie was more than a pet—she was family. Her playful pounces, gentle purrs, and comforting cuddles brought warmth to my soul. 
        She taught me the true meaning of unconditional love, and I’ll forever be grateful for every moment I spent with her. ❤️

        "Some angels choose fur instead of wings."

      <p>
        Callie brought endless joy to my days. Here are some of my favorite memories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Her comforting purrs that always seemed to come at the perfect moment.</li>
        <li>Her curious little head tilts whenever she heard a new sound.</li>
        <li>The way she would claim the sunniest spot in the house as her throne.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        She may not be with me now, but her spirit lives on in every smile, every warm memory, and every heartbeat. ❤️
