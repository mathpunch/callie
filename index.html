      <p>
        Callie was more than a pet‚Äîshe was family. Her playful pounces, gentle purrs, and comforting cuddles brought warmth to my soul. 
        She taught me the true meaning of unconditional love, and I‚Äôll forever be grateful for every moment I spent with her. ‚ù§Ô∏è

      <h2>Memories of Callie</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "Some angels choose fur instead of wings."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Callie brought endless joy to my days. Here are some of my favorite memories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Her comforting purrs that always seemed to come at the perfect moment.</li>
        <li>Her curious little head tilts whenever she heard a new sound outside.</li>
        <li>The way she would hunt inside or outside for any moving things she could find.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        She may not be with me now, but her spirit lives on in every smile, every warm memory, and every heartbeat. ‚ù§Ô∏è
