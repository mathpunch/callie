      <h2>Memories of Callie</h2>
      <p>Callie was more than a pet—she was a part of my soul. Here are some of the special moments I’ll always hold close to my heart:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The way she would curl up on my lap during rainy days, her purring as comforting as the rain outside.</li>
        <li>Her playful streak, chasing after strings and acting like the queen of the house.</li>
        <li>The soft nuzzles she'd give me when she knew I needed comfort the most.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every day with Callie was a gift, and I miss her more than words can express. She will forever be my light and love. ❤️</p>
